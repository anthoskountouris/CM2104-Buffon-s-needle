# Monte Carlo Simulation of Buffon's Needle Experiments with MATLAB GUI

## Description:
This project involves the development of a MATLAB GUI application that allows users to perform Monte Carlo simulations of variations of Buffon's needle experiments. The GUI enables users to estimate the mathematical constant π (pi) using different experimental setups. The tasks included in this project involve simulating the dropping of squares and needles on various surfaces to estimate π and other irrational numbers. Users can customize the experiment parameters, visualize the experiments, and even analyze the orientation of dropped objects. Additionally, the project encourages the implementation of novel extensions or features to enhance the simulation capabilities.
